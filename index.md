# The Fictionario Chronicles: A Tale of Speed and Spite

There once was a developer who created a game called Fictionario, it was quite a good game and very popular. So of course a certain subset of its fans decided to play through it as fast as they could. This didn't really interest the developer and he felt they were missing out on some of the great experiences he had put in the game. But they were just this small group and they weren't really causing problems for anyone else. So he went on his way working on the next great phase of his game.

This group was mostly made up of competitive individuals and so naturally leaderboards were created to keep track of who was going fastest. That of course quickly led to all sorts of improbable claims. So videos of the playthrough were then required to show that these ridiculous times had actually happened. It also turned out that it was quite entertaining to watch these videos. And so while most players did not have the most fun playing the game as fast as possible, a much larger portion did most enjoy watching the game this way.

Thus as the time neared to release the new expansion, the Marketing Department came to the developer and said, "We need to generate more hype!" This of course is what they always said, so he started to think about why the conveyors still wouldn't build across each other like they were supposed. But then just as he realised that there was a really elegant solution, they said "We should have a LAN party." This was a bit distracting and certainly out of character for the Marketing Department.

"We just had one last week and some of you spent the whole time putting display panels around the map", he said while rather pointedly looking at one junior member in particular.

"No no, not an office party. We'll invite the most popular content creators who play our game and then they will tell all their followers about it and we will have more hype!"

Now this did sound fun and having outside people in to play would probably help turn up a few bugs in the new areas that hadn't been found yet as well.

"That sounds good", and then he had another thought, "I want to make sure they aren't going to spoil the game for all their followers though."

"Don't worry, we'll have everyone agree to not talk about information we haven't already released."

And so it was arranged. The developer spent several weeks polishing the expansion to a state he felt comfortable showing off. He had built in what he estimated to be roughly two hundred and fifty hours of delightful automation challenges, each more intricate than the last, a grand journey that would take players from their humble starting planet to the very edge of the solar system, like a clockwork universe designed by someone who had never quite grasped the concept of "easy mode."

The day of the LAN party arrived with all the pomp and circumstance that Marketing could muster on a budget that had already been mostly spent on ergonomic chairs and premium coffee. Forty of the game's most celebrated content creators arrived, each carrying the sort of gaming equipment that suggested they took their virtual conveyor belts very seriously indeed. The developer had arranged for them to be split into four groups, which seemed like a reasonable way to manage such a crowd. What he hadn't quite anticipated was that Marketing had, with their characteristic efficiency in matters best left to chance, managed to place all ten of the game's most notorious optimization enthusiasts in the same group.

The developer gave a brief presentation about the expansion, explaining with genuine enthusiasm how players would need to establish interplanetary logistics networks, construct orbital platforms, and eventually build a massive propulsion system capable of reaching the edge of the solar system itself. He estimated, quite confidently, that reaching this final goal would take most players between two and three hundred hours.

"Right then," said the developer, clapping his hands together, "shall we see how you get on?"

What happened next could best be described as watching a group of surgeons perform an operation while riding motorcycles. The optimization enthusiasts set about the expansion with the sort of methodical precision that would have impressed a Swiss watchmaker, if Swiss watchmakers were in the habit of ignoring ninety percent of the mechanism and focusing solely on making the hands move as quickly as possible.

Within the first hour, they had discovered a combination of interplanetary cargo rockets and asteroid mining platforms to create what one cheerfully dubbed "a resource multiplication loop that bends, but doesn't break, the laws of physics." By hour six, they had somehow managed to skip the entire second planet by using a technique involving rocket fuel and what appeared to be either genius or madness—the developer wasn't entirely sure which.

The developer watched with growing unease as his carefully crafted progression system was systematically dismantled like a house of cards in a hurricane. These players weren't savoring the intricate ballet of interplanetary logistics he had choreographed; they were performing what could only be described as cosmic breakdancing.

By the end of the first day, they had reached the outer planets. The developer's eye began to twitch.

"How are you finding the asteroid belt navigation challenges?" he asked, trying to maintain his composure while watching one player use a bug involving space platform logistics to teleport resources between planets.

"Oh, we skipped those," replied the most popular member of the group, a cheerful fellow whose online persona was built around destroying games in ways their creators never intended. "Turns out if you crash two cargo rockets at exactly the right angle near a space platform, the game thinks you've already established trade routes with every planet."

The developer made a note. Several notes, actually, most of which were underlined multiple times.

On the morning of the third day, with approximately seventy-three hours elapsed, the edge of the solar system had been reached. The developer stood behind the assembled optimization enthusiasts, watching his magnum opus being concluded in roughly a quarter of the time he had anticipated, and felt something stirring in his chest that was definitely not pride.

"Congratulations," he said, his voice carrying the sort of hollow enthusiasm typically reserved for telling someone their goldfish is "just resting." "That was... quite fast."

"Thanks!" beamed the lead optimizer. "Great expansion! Can't wait to see how quickly we can get it down to under fifty hours once we optimize the route properly."

The developer excused himself and went to find a very strong cup of coffee and a notebook. A special notebook. One that he would later come to think of as his "Balance Changes" notebook, though the Marketing Department would probably have preferred the term "Quality of Life Improvements."


Videos of the LAN party spread across the internet, and completion times plummeted at an alarming rate. Over the following months, the developer made small adjustments to the game. Little things, really. Nothing dramatic.

Cargo rocket trajectories could no longer intersect within certain coordinates near space platforms, for instance. A minor tweak to prevent "resource multiplication exploits," he explained in the patch notes, though he somehow forgot to mention that this particular combination had never actually multiplied resources—it had simply allowed more efficient interplanetary transportation.

Space platform logistics were updated to prevent "unintended behavior," which coincidentally made the teleportation technique impossible. Rocket crashes now resulted in "more realistic debris patterns," which coincidentally made the planet-skipping considerably more difficult to execute.

With each update, the completion times increased. The community grumbled, but adapted. They found new routes, new tricks, new ways to dance through the solar system in ways the developer had never intended.

And with each new optimization video that appeared, showing his masterpiece being completed in ever more innovative and efficient ways, the developer would return to his Balance Changes notebook and make yet another small adjustment.

After all, he reasoned, players should experience the game the way it was meant to be played. They should appreciate the careful progression, the gradual unlocking of technologies, the satisfaction of building something truly magnificent rather than simply rushing to the end.

The fact that they seemed to derive genuine joy from their high-speed industrial acrobatics was, he felt, somewhat beside the point.

As a wise man might observe, the developer had fallen into the classic trap: mistaking his preferred playstyle as the only valid playstyle. And as any experienced gamer knows, the moment you start trying to force players to have fun in exactly the way you intended is precisely the moment when fun begins to pack its bags and look for the nearest exit.

But that, as they say, is a story for another day. Or perhaps another patch note.
