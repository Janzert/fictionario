# Overview

Developer creates wonderful game. Speedrunners play it in unexpected ways. Developer doesn't particularly like how they play. Speedrunners become quite popular. Developer dislike is cemented when they beat new expansion unexpectedly fast at beta test/PR lan party. Developer then pays attention to how speedrunners play to make changes to force "correct" play of game.

Written in style of Terry Pratchett.

# Story

There once was a developer who created a game called Fictionario, it was quite a good game and very popular. So of course a certain subset of its fans decided to play through it as fast as they could. This didn't really interest the developer and he felt they were missing out on some of the great experiences he had put in the game. But they were just this small group and they weren't really causing problems for anyone else. So he went on his way working on the next great phase of his game.

This group was mostly made up of competitive individuals and so naturally leaderboards were created to keep track of who was going fastest. That of course quickly led to all sorts of improbable claims. So videos of the playthrough were then required to show that these ridiculous times had actually happened. It also turned out that it was quite entertaining to watch these videos. And so while most players did not have the most fun playing the game as fast as possible, a much larger portion did most enjoy watching the game this way.

Thus as the time neared to release the new expansion, the Marketing Department came to the developer and said, "We need to generate more hype!" This of course is what they always said, so he started to think about why the conveyors still wouldn't build across each other like they were supposed. But then just as he realised that there was a really elegant solution, they said "We should have a LAN party." This was a bit distacting and certainly out of character for the Marketing Department.

"We just had one last week and some of you spent the whole time putting display panels around the map", he said while rather pointedly looking at one junior member in particular.

"No no, not an office party. We'll invite the most popular content creators who play  our game and then they will tell all their followers about it and we will have more hype!"

Now this did sound fun and having outside people in to play would probably help turn up a few bugs in the new areas that hadn't been found yet as well.

"That sounds good", and then he had another thought, "I want to make sure they aren't going to spoil the game for all their followers though."

"Don't worry, we'll have everyone agree to not talk about information we haven't already released."

*ChatGPT continuation*

"And maybe," added the developer, a little slyly, "we don't quite let them see everything."

And so the LAN party was scheduled, and the content creators were summoned like digital druids to a pixelated Stonehenge, drawn by the twin lures of free snacks and early access. Among them, of course, were the speedrunners—those wiry-eyed mystics of motion, the sacred order of Glitchus Exploiticus, whose patron deity was apparently a stopwatch and whose holy text was a spreadsheet.

They arrived, keyboards in tow, their fingers twitching like hounds scenting the fox. They nodded politely at the developer, who nodded politely back in a manner that suggested he would rather be debugging lava flow physics.

Now, the developer had spent quite a lot of time designing the expansion. There were carefully curated pacing arcs, artfully concealed foreshadowing, narrative beats one could set a metronome to. The opening area alone contained what he considered a chef-d'œuvre of environmental storytelling involving a toppled vending machine, a forlorn janitor-bot, and a suspiciously well-lit ventilation duct.

The first speedrunner bypassed it in fourteen seconds by surfing on a loose piece of collision mesh and clipping through a geometry seam the developer didn’t even know was there. The second speedrunner used a technique they cheerfully dubbed “quantum butt-jumping,” and the third managed to zip straight to the final boss arena by stacking three jars of mayonnaise and weaponizing the in-game physics in a way that would have made Sir Isaac Newton ask for a drink and a lie-down.

It was over in twelve minutes. Not the boss fight—the expansion.

The marketing team clapped and cheered. The developer did not. He did a kind of slow blink that would have been worrying in a cat, and left the room muttering about metaphysics and mayonnaise.

From that moment on, something in him shifted. Not in a major way at first. Just… a pebble in the shoe of his soul.

He began to watch the speedrunners. Quietly, obsessively. Late at night he would pore over their videos, eyes red-rimmed, pausing frame by frame like a Renaissance scholar trying to divine heresy from scripture. He took notes. Charts. Diagrams. He began to say things like “Aha!” and “Not this time!” to no one in particular.

And when the next patch came out, the speedrunners were greeted by subtle, peculiar changes.

The hallway that used to allow a neat sequence break now contained an oddly specific crate labeled “Absolutely Not a Sequence Break Here, Please Walk Around.”

The classic wall-clip technique involving barrel-stacking now summoned a pop-up window that said, “This is not how barrels work.”

Someone even noticed that trying to jump onto the roof in one specific town would now trigger a sudden in-game cutscene featuring an angry NPC librarian chasing the player back indoors while shouting, “YOU’VE MISSED ALL THE CONTEXT!”

The speedrunners adapted, of course. They always did. What is a wall if not an invitation? But now it was a war. A cold, passive-aggressive, code-level war, fought with hotfixes and workarounds, bugs and devblogs. The players had moved on from just playing Fictionario. Now, they were playing the developer.

And the developer?

He was finally having fun again.

Which is, in its own way, the true endgame.
