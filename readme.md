# Backstory 

After the change to achievements in Factorio v2.0.45 to that basically killed
100% speedrunning as it had been for close to a decade. Along with a few other
changes since the release of Space Age, that really felt punitive toward the
speedrunning community. I was feeling pretty disheartened to do anything
factorio related so I thought I'd give it a go at writing a small story giving
a bit of humorous take on the situation.

Of course, as is want to happen, after writing about 25% I got distractted and
let the story languish. After a few weeks of that I thought I'd try letting
a few of the current AI's finish it off and see how it would come out. So that
is what you see here.
